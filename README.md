# Programming parade
Self learnt stuff which I coded ãƒ¾(ï¿£â–½ï¿£)

These are some of the codes in C++ and C# as well which I coded in Visual Studio 2019 as a means to have my knowledge grow broader in the field of programming as I find it quite interesting!
<br>
For now its just basic codes which everyone knows already ðŸ˜… since I started learning it from scratch, so feel free to let me know if there's anything you find to be an error or anything of the sort :)
<br>
Upcoming codes in Python as well!
